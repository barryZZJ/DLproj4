    """
    Construct a line series plot.

    Arguments:
        xs (array of arrays, or array): Array of arrays of x values
        ys (array of arrays): Array of y values
        title (string): Plot title.
        xname: Title of x-axis

    Returns:
        A plot object, to be passed to wandb.log()

    Example:
        ```
        When logging a singular array for x, all ys are plotted against that x
        x = [i for i in range(10)]
        ys = [
            [i for i in range(10)],
            [i**2 for i in range(10)]
        ]
        wandb.log({'line-series-plot1': wandb.plot.line_series(x, ys, "title", "step")})

        xs can also contain an array of arrays for having different steps for each metric
        xs = [[i for i in range(10)], [2*i for i in range(10)]]
        ys = [
            [i for i in range(10)],

        ]
